Each setting presents unique logistical challenges, such as different waste generation rhythms, vehicle constraints, and road network characteristics. Extending and adapting the synthetic data generation, pre- dicting, and optimization methods to these varied contexts would enhance the ver- satility and scalability of the overall framework. In summary, future work should focus on real-world validation, dynamic integra- tionofpredictiveandoperationalmodels, robustuncertaintyhandling, andextension toward sustainability-centric objectives.
